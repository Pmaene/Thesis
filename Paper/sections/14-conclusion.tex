\section{Conclusion}

Voter-verifiable systems can be used to improve voter confidence. Helios is such a system that can be used to organise online elections. \ref{sec:procedure} gave the procedure that should be followed to setup an election. The interface was also modified to clarify it to the election administrator. After making some final adjustments, the system was then used for the VTK board election. Before deploying the system, both it's functionality and usability were tested. Consequently, no big problems were encountered during the election day.

\par The Web Cryptography API will make high-level cryptographic functions available to web developers. It also offers a considerable performance increase compared to existing JavaScript libraries. It's biggest disadvantage is the small set of supported algorithms, which limits the possible applications. It also proved hard to import existing keys into the user agent's store.
